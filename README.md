This project simulates dynamic airline ticket pricing using Monte Carlo methods. It models customer behavior across fare buckets (Economy, Flex, Premium, Business) using exponential demand functions and time-sensitive booking patterns. Prices adjust over time based on sales performance, with mechanisms to test different repricing thresholds and sensitivity parameters.

Key features include:

1. Discrete fare bucket structure with capacity and elasticity

2. Day-by-day booking simulation with 100 customers per day

3. Dynamic price adjustments based on actual vs expected demand

4. Visualizations of revenue distributions, price paths, and demand curves

5. Configurable logic for future experimentation and policy design
